NOTE:
This project is made and pushed to clarify my doubts regarding charts in future.
If you are tired of implementing chart.js in angular project, try my way


"NPM I" or "YARN ADD"
for installing packages

then ,
"NPM START"

if you are facing any issues while running it,
just ping me on instagram
